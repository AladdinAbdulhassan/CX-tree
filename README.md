# CX-tree
This code was built in Delphi 2010
In this work, an X-tree was built.
Cuckoo filters were integrated during construction time and the resulting data structure was used to classify the network packets according to a predefined set of filters called rule-set.
You can read the code by editing the Unit1.pas file or by install Delphi 2010 and open the attached project1.dpr file (all the related files are attached)
The rule-set 9000 rules was attached in excel file format with the name of Datarules.xlsx.
